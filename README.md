# Automatic-Topic-Detection
In the past several years, topic models have seen a rise in their popularity due to the expeditious growth of text data. However, those texts are either in short-form or long-form. In this study, we elucidated topic models for both regular documents and short text. We explained the differences between regular documents and short text documents. The standard topic models are Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). These models performed very well in extracting topics from regular documents. However, this research mainly focuses on short text topic models. Short text documents contain less information and word co-occurrence,
which leads to a data sparsity problem. Because of the sparsity problem, the standard topic models may not perform very well on short text documents. 

## 1. To solve the sparsity problems in short text data, many short text topic models have been developed, such as a 


1. #### DMM based
  - Gibbs sampling algorithm for Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (GS-DMM)


2. #### Word Embedding (DMM based)
- Latent Feature Dirichlet Mixture Model (LF-DMM)
- Generalized Polya Urn -Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (GPU-DMM)
- Generalized Polya Urn - Poisson-based Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (GPU-PDMM)
- 
**"Note" If users train these models based word embeddings, users need to download the Pre-trained word embedding [Global Vectors](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).**

3. #### Global word co-occurrences
- Biterm Topic Model (BTM), 
- World Network Topic Model (WNTM)


4. #### Self-Aggregation
- SelfAggregation Topic model (SATM)
- Pseudo-document-based Topic Modeling (PTM).


#### We used all these models, and each model is trained on five different real-world short text datasets. 
We used the STTM open-source java Library

**Short Text Topic Model** [STTM Library](https://github.com/qiang2100/STTM)

## 2. Later, we evaluated the performance of each model on each dataset 
using three different metrics, including 
1. Classification (Accuracy)
2. Topic Coherence (PMIscore)
3. Clustering (Purity and NMI) 
 
we reported the average mean of each of the metrics.


**For Computing topic coherence, Wikipedia dump dataset is needed to score word pairs using term co-occurrence in the paper [Automatic Evaluation of Topic Coherence](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1857999.1858011). Here, we calculate the pointwise mutual information (PMI) of each word pair, estimated from the entire corpus of over 1M English Wikipedia articles. Using a sliding window of 10-words to identify co-occurrence, we computed the PMI of all a given word pairs**


## 3. We tested the impact of pre-processing on the datasets and the efficiency of each model. 
To investigate the impact of pre-processing on the performance of the topic modeling, we train the GS-DMM on the StackOverflow datase

## 4. Finally, we investigated the influence of 
1. Number of topics K 
2. Number of iterations
3. Number of pseudo documents for PTM and SATM 
4. Impact of M and Î» on GPU-PDMM
